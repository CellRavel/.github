# CellRavel (*Unraveling the Secrets of Cells*)

Welcome to CellRavel! We are a community-driven initiative focused on exploring the fascinating world of bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, cancer research, and immunotherapy. Our goal is to unlock the mysteries of cellular behavior through bioinformatics and advance scientific understanding through cutting-edge research and collaboration.

## üå± What's Coming Up?

We are in the early stages of developing educational content and potentially research initiatives for the open source community. Our focus will be on providing high-quality educational resources and eventually launching collaborative research projects. We are currently planning several exciting projects:

- **Education**: Developing free comprehensive educational resources on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cellravel) for those interested in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, AI, Cancer Research, and Immunotherapy; from beginners to advanced practitioners!
  - Checkout our first project: [PATOG](https://github.com/CellRavel/patog) (Curated Collection of Resources around Bioinformatics, Data Science, ML, etc.)

- **Tools**: Developing innovative software for analyzing biological data.

- **AI in Healthcare**: Combining machine learning techniques to improve cancer diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. We are investigating how AI can be used to better harness the immune system in the fight against cancer.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute or collaborate with us once we prepare to kick off our projects in the near future!
